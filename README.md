# Contact-Form
This is my first project.
I used only HTML and CSS.
I recommend viewing in full screen.
If you reduce the width of the window, at one point the image will disappear and only contact sheet will be visible. I used cool transition effects on &lt;select> tag and &lt;submit> tag too.
I learned a lot of new things while making this project and it helped me in understanding the basics.
Overall this project was a good experience for me to get started on my path to becoming a full stack developer.
